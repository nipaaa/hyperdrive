        <h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
        <p>
          The Solana HYPERDRIVE Hackathon is a competition where projects will
          be evaluated by judges on their technological merits without
          consideration of legal viability. Participants in the Hackathon will
          create software solely for purposes of evaluation by judges as part of
          a competition and not for commercial deployment or release as part of
          the Hackathon. All participants must comply with applicable laws and
          regulations when releasing any software that they develop as part of
          the Hackathon. <br /> <br /> The developer resources that Solana
          Foundation (“SF”) provides are for educational and inspirational
          purposes only. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the
          deployment of any such applications in violation of applicable laws or
          regulations. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment,
          integration or use of any such applications (including the code
          comprising the Solana blockchain protocol) in violation of applicable
          laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment,
          integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by the
          reader (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the
          United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if the reader
          is located in or ordinarily resides in a country or territory subject
          to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign
          Assets Control (OFAC), (c) if the reader is or is working on behalf of
          a Specially Designated National (SDN) or is a person subject to
          similar blocking or denied party prohibitions, or (d) in violation of
          the Commodities and Exchange Act.
